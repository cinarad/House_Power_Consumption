# Data Exploration and Regression Analysis

This project was conducted as part of the Foundation of Data Science course within the first year of the Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Science. Python programming language was utilised for the implementation.

The project aims to investigate household power consumption using a dataset from a specific household near Paris, France. The goal is to develop a reliable model for analysing and predicting power consumption based on electric equipment usage, primarily focusing on global active power. The analysis includes data exploration, visualisation, correlation analysis, and model development.

The dataset covers almost 4 years of electric power consumption measurements, including variables such as global active power, voltage, and sub-metering for different electric equipment. Data exploration involves cleaning and summarising the dataset, while visualisation techniques help understand trends and patterns in power consumption over time and by different equipment categories.

Correlation analysis reveals relationships between variables, with a focus on multicollinearity, linearity, and homoscedasticity assumptions. Linear regression models are applied to predict power consumption, with attention to model assumptions and potential improvements. Iterations of the model include adding independent variables to enhance predictive accuracy.

However, the analysis identifies several challenges, including violations of assumptions such as homoscedasticity, normality, and independence. These issues suggest the need for further analysis and potential model adjustments, such as data transformation or the inclusion of additional variables, to improve predictive accuracy.

Overall, the project contributes to understanding household power consumption patterns and suggests ways to optimise energy usage, benefiting both households and the environment.
